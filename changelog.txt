-known bugs:
* an old save file has a different format and might fuck shit up, need to put in a check for this somehow, count the lines in the file or whatnot
* the slider circle for scrollSpeed sometimes goes outside to the left when you first start up the game
* zombies move up left for some reason, "feature" of erratic behavior
* civilians run to corners and refuse to run sideways when they hit a wall. oh well, if they want to die that bad...
